/* Guidance Concerning Browser-based Clients /*

* GENERAL THEORY *
[01] currently, compatibility is dictated by a browsers support for two specific functions related to the DICOM standard:
     + architecture must be, or have native support for, 32bit architectures,
     + support for JPEG2000a image compression,
     + support for security zones based on data-types and authorizations,
     + support for 32bit JVM code execution.

[02] in the near-term, in addition to the two factors listed above, a browser will also need to support the following:
     + TLS1.2 based end-point encryption,
     + native support for WADO,
     + native support for HTML5,
     + PKCS12 client/server encryption.

[03] to users, image compression applies algorithms to present the underlying image data in a way that minimizes the
     resources necessary to stream and then view high quality greyscale images while not reducing the quality or accuracy of it.

[04] on the backend, JPEG2000 is fundamental to longterm archiving and data interchange.

[05] DICOM software must be release with a DICOM Comformance Statement to ensure interoperability between different
     vendor implementations of DICOM.  If this document references JPEG2000 

[06] DICOM operates at a low-level, encoding metadata into DICOM files that dictate how it should be processed.  In 
     practice DICOM is implemented in Java for obvious reasons, chief among them is the separation of logic from the
     underlying hardware that it runs on.  Therefore, any DICOM software is heavily dependent on the specific version
     Of Java that it was compiled to run on, oftentimes down to the specific release versions.

[07] DICOM, being primarily a data storage and encoding protocol, relies on systems external to it to operate properly.
     For example, while DICOM3 implements DICOM-TLS as a standard, it only defines the standards, leaving to others to decide
     how best to implement it.  Other than the encryption algorithm, things like specific PKI software, the bit values used, etc
     are left undefined.

[08] medical imaging is an industry who defines their own standards through NEMA.  Naturally, some members of that body have
     more influence then others.  GE, Varian, Phillips, FujiFilms, and Kodak, having an outsized share of the market, are
     influential in setting the agenda.  Unsurprisingly, compatibility between the DICOM implementations of these vendors are the
     most challenging, but once understood, the same logic can be applied to other implementations based in theirs.
